# QA Checklist

## Manual QA (BUGFIX)

- [ ] Fresh install → onboarding starts, grant permissions path works, queue is shown.
- [ ] Deny permissions → denial message is shown, **Open Settings** works, return path works.
- [ ] Swipe keep/delete + **Undo** → card advances and counters update correctly.
- [ ] **Free space now** flow → both cancel and confirm paths behave correctly.
- [ ] Paywall flow → **Buy**, **Restore purchases**, and **Not now** do meaningful actions.
- [ ] Empty queue → **Rescan** works and queue can continue from there.

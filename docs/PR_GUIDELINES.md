# PR Guidelines

- PR title must be in English.
- PR description must be in English.
- Commit messages must be in English.

## Binary files policy
- Do not commit binaries unless explicitly required by the task.
- If binary is required, prefer Git LFS for tracked binaries.
- If Git LFS is not appropriate, attach binary as a release asset and document why.
